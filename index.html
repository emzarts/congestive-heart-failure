            Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a highly prevalent heart condition 
            in which the heart is unable to pump blood properly.
            Heart failure is chronic and has a high mortality rate. Additionally
            , CHF greatly affects the daily lives of those who have it.
            Over 26 million people worldwide have CHF, and the number of cases 
            are continuously increasing. (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5494150/)
            
            <br><br>
            When the heart is unable to properly pump blood, it often backs up 
            in parts of the body like the lower legs and major organs like the 
            lungs. There are many scenarios that cause this failure, which is 
            part of why it is so common. This public service announcement will go over the different
            symptoms of CHF, how it affects the body, its different stages, 
            and treatment.

        <h2>Types of Heart Failure</h2>
        <p>
          Heart failure can either be due to systolic or diastolic failure. 
          Each type of failure has to do with how much blood the heart can take
          in or output. Systolic Heart Failure is when the heart is unable to 
          pump out enough blood. This could be due to the heart muscle being 
          too weak to pump out blood. Diastolic Heart Failure is when the 
          heart is unable to fill completely with blood. This could be due to 
          stiff muscle not being able to relax, or thicker tissue in that
          ventricle. The heart failure 
          is also classified by the left and right sides, where the failure is 
          being caused. Oftentimes, the failure of one side will lead to 
          problems with both.

        <h2>Stages</h2>
        <p>CHF is split into stages based on the severity of the case.</p>
        <table>
          <tr>
            <td class="stage"> 
              Stage A

            <td>
              This stage indicates that a patient is at high risk for heart 
              failure. They may have one of the conditions that leads to CHF, or 
              have a family history.
            </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>

              Stage B

            <td>
              In this stage, a patient has a heart dysfunction but has yet to 
              experience symptoms of CHF.

          <tr>

              Stage C
            </td>
            <td>
              Patients begin to experience symptoms of CHF in stage C. This can 
              include fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.

              The last stage of heart failure is when patients are experiencing 
              extreme symptoms that do not improve. Surgery or transplant are the 
              only treatments for this stage.

          <h2>Causes</h2>
          <p>
            There are many conditions that lead to the development of CHF. 
            Anything that can inhibit the heart's ability to function can cause 
            heart failure. Below is a list of common causes:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Coronary artery disease
              </li>
              <li>
                High blood pressure
              </li>
              <li>
                Diabetes
              </li>
              <li>
                Obesity            
              </li>
              <li>
                Renal failure
              </li>
              <li>
                Metabolic syndrome
              </li>
              <li>
                Forms of heart disease       
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Along with this list, there are many groups that are predisposed to 
            heart failure. This includes people aged 65+, those who are 
            overweight, smokers, African Americans, and men. (https://medlineplus.gov/heartfailure.html)
            Physical activity also plays a role, as well as less educated groups. (Tripoliti)

          <h2>Effect on the Body</h2>
          <p>
            Affects the sympathetic nervous system by causing it to overdrive,
            also increasing the amount 
            of adrenaline. Increases heart rate and overall stress levels.
            Can cause the inner lining of the heart to fail. Can 
            cause the left chamber of the heart to thicken due to the increased 
            stress on its tissues (Figure 1). Also causes the development of
            atherosclerosis, in which plaque builds up in the arteries that can 
            restrict blood flow. Causes an irregular heartbeat. Can cause necrosis
            where the heart cells die due to lack of blood supply.

            Figure 1. The graphic above shows an image of a healthy heart on the left. On 
            the right is a heart with Left Ventricular Hypertrophy. The tissue 
            on the rigthmost side of the photo (the left side of the heart) 
            is much thicker than in a healthy heart.

        <p>
          Due to modern advances in technology... there are tools for detecting 
          CHF 
          Congestive heart failure has been well documented and studied since
          TODO FIND A DATE. However,... talk about the use of machine learning 
          and AI to detect.
