            Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) is a highly prevalent heart condition 
            in which the heart is unable to pump blood properly.
            Heart failure is chronic and has a high mortality rate. Additionally, 
            CHF greatly affects the daily lives of those who have it, making 
            everyday tasks difficult.
            Over 26 million people worldwide have CHF, and the number of cases 
            are continuously increasing. (Savarese,  2017)
            <br><br>
            Heart Failure is caused by other diseases or conditions that weaken 
            the heart.
            When the heart is unable to properly pump blood, it often backs up 
            in parts of the body like the lower legs and major organs like the 
            lungs. There are many scenarios that cause this failure, which is 
            part of why it is so common. 
            This public service announcement will go over the different
            symptoms of CHF, how it affects the body, its different stages, 
            and treatment.

        <h2>Types of Heart Failure</h2>
        <p>
          Heart failure can either be due to <b>systolic</b> or <b>diastolic</b> failure. 
          Each type of failure has to do with how much blood the heart can take
          in or output. Systolic Heart Failure is when the heart is unable to 
          pump out enough blood. This could be due to the heart muscle being 
          too weak to pump out the normal amount. Diastolic Heart Failure is when the 
          heart is unable to fill completely with blood. This could be due to 
          stiff muscle not being able to relax, or thicker tissue in that
          ventricle. Heart failure 
          is also classified by the left and right sides to indicate where the failure is 
          being caused. Oftentimes, failure of one side will lead to 
          problems with both.

        <h2>Stages</h2>
        <p>CHF is split into stages based on the severity of the case.</p>

          <h2>Causes</h2>
          <p>
            There are many conditions that lead to the development of CHF. 
            Anything that can inhibit the heart's ability to function can cause 
            heart failure. Below is a list of common causes:
          </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Coronary artery disease
              </li>
              <li>
                High blood pressure
              </li>
              <li>
                Diabetes
              </li>
              <li>
                Obesity            
              </li>
              <li>
                Renal failure
              </li>
              <li>
                Metabolic syndrome
              </li>
              <li>
                Forms of heart disease       
              </li>
            </ul>
          <p>
            Along with this list, there are many groups that are predisposed to 
            heart failure. This includes people aged 65+, those who are 
            overweight, smokers, African Americans, and men ("Congestive Heart Failure", 2020). 
            Physical activity also plays a role, as well as less educated groups (Tripoliti, 2017).

          <h2>How Does CHF Affect the Body?</h2>
          <p>
            In the early stages, congestive heart failure 
            Affects the sympathetic nervous system by causing it to overdrive,
            also increasing the amount 
            of adrenaline. Increases heart rate and overall stress levels.
            Can cause the inner lining of the heart to fail. Can 
            cause the left chamber of the heart to thicken due to the increased 
            stress on its tissues (Figure 1). Also causes the development of
            atherosclerosis, in which plaque builds up in the arteries that can 
            restrict blood flow. Causes an irregular heartbeat. Can cause necrosis
            where the heart cells die due to lack of blood supply.

          The first step to getting treated for heart failure is to visit a 
          doctor. When treating, they will take into account any medical history
          of heart conditions that may increase risk of CHF. They will also begin
          with a physical examination, taking blood pressure and pulse. This will
          detect any immediate irregularities. X-Rays can be used to look at 
          the state of the heart and lungs, checking for physical issues there 
          or fluid buildup ("Heart failure", 2013). 
          <br><br>
          Electrocardiograms can also check if your heart is beating properly
          and has the correct rhythm (Figure 2). All of these methods are checking 
          that the heart is functioning as it should be.
          Tests for other underlying heart issues can also be used to check a
          patient's risk for heart failure.
          <br><br>
          Once diagnosed, steps can be taken to improve the symptoms of heart 
          failure, however it is chronic so cannot be completely healed.
          Depending on the cause for heart failure, different treatments are used. 
          Medications can be given to slow heart rate, lower blood pressure, 
          and improve the overall function of the heart. Transplants and other 
          surgeries are also an option for worse cases of CHF. Implants and 
          heart assistants can also help the heart beat or strengthen it.
          Lifestyle changes can also be used to generally strengthen the heart. 
          These changes are also used alongside other treatments ("Heart failure", 2013).
          <br><br>
          These treatments can improve and lengthen the lives of patients with 
          CHF but are not able to cure it.

        <h2>Current research</h2>
        <p>
          Because Congestive Heart Failure cannot be cured, it is important 
          to always improve the methods being used to detect it in early stages 
          and treat it later. Technology is evolving fast in the medical field and is 
          being used to improve treatment techniques. Some fascinating research 
          is also being conducted to detect CHF in its early stages through 
          machine learning. Studies like <i>Heart Failure: Diagnosis, Severity Estimation and Prediction of Adverse Events Through Machine Learning Techniques.</i>
          are using machine learning models to detect heart abnormalities and 
          use patient data to determine the type of heart failure that they have
          and classify it. <br><br>
          CHF may never be cured, but it is being extensively studied and 
          techniques of treatment are being improved upon.
